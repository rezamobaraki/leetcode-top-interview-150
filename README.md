2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rezamobaraki/leetcode-top-interview-150.git
    cd leetcode-top-interview-150/golang
    ```
3. Run the Go files:
    ```sh
    go run <filename>.go
    ```

### Python

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rezamobaraki/leetcode-top-interview-150.git
    cd leetcode-top-interview-150/python
    ```
3. Run the Python files:
    ```sh
    python <filename>.py
    ```

### JavaScript

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rezamobaraki/leetcode-top-interview-150.git
    cd leetcode-top-interview-150/javascript
    ```
3. Run the JavaScript files:
    ```sh
    node <filename>.js
    ```

### TypeScript

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rezamobaraki/leetcode-top-interview-150.git
    cd leetcode-top-interview-150/typescript
    ```
3. Compile and run the TypeScript files:
    ```sh
    tsc <filename>.ts
    node <filename>.js
    ```

## Usage

Each file in the `golang/`, `python/`, `javascript/`, and `typescript/` directories corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem. You can run the files to see the solutions in action.

### Example

To run the `is-subsequence` solution in Go:
```sh
cd golang/two-pointer
go run is-subsequence.go
```

To run the `is-subsequence` solution in Python:
```sh
cd python/two-pointer
python is-subsequence.py
```

To run the `is-subsequence` solution in JavaScript:
```sh
cd javascript/two-pointer
node is-subsequence.js
```

To run the `is-subsequence` solution in TypeScript:
```sh
cd typescript/two-pointer
tsc is-subsequence.ts
node is-subsequence.js
```

### Running the Solutions

To run any solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the file using the respective language's command.

### Testing the Solutions

You can add test cases to the main function or use testing frameworks like `unittest` for Python, `testing` for Go, `jest` for JavaScript, and `jest` for TypeScript.

### Adding New Solutions

1. Create a new file in the appropriate directory (`golang/`, `python/`, `javascript/`, or `typescript/`).
2. Implement the solution for the LeetCode problem.
3. Add test cases to the main function or a separate test file.
